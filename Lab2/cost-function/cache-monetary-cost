Rationale:

As stated in [1], L1 and L2 caches are often implemented as SRAM modules.
Therefore, a rough estimate of the monetary cost (in EUR) of L1 and L2 cache
per KB can be given by the lines:

	0.34x for L2 cache (assume L2 access time 5 nsec)
	2.23x for L1 cache (assume L1 access time 1 nsec)

where x equals cache size in KB (1 KB = 1000B)

Data origin was Mouser and Arrow Electronics prices for SRAM modules of
the respective access times.
