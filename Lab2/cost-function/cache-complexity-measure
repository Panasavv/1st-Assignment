Converting to relative energy (divide by 2-way assoc value)
the best fit polynomial is:

	0.46 + 0.25x +0.0076x^{2} - 0.00007x^{3} (x: 0-64)


Rationale:

Cache associativity reduces miss rates, but at cost of complexity and power
consumption. Our cost function takes into account:
 - monetary cost (for L1-L2 cache sizes)
 - complexity cost (L1-L2 cache associativity)
 
The above polynomial approximates the relative power consumption per read
as a rough measure of complexity. Data was taken from simulation in CACTI
(cache sim mentioned in P&H) of a 90nm process cache (128k, 64 byte blocks).

For simplicity purposes, we assume that the same relationship exists between
associativity and "complexity cost" regardless of cache size.
